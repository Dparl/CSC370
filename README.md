for anything that uses the actual arduino, make sure that the upload.bat file:
    isn't still .bat.hex,
    references the correct COM (COM3 or COM4) 
    that the file it references is the right one (last thing on line should be filename.hex)
    that its in the Debug folder when you double click on it to run
